
## 🏦 AI Banking Assistant Overview

AI Banking Assistant is an intelligent chatbot platform designed for modern banking services.
It combines React (frontend) and Django (backend) with advanced AI technologies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Mistral models served via Ollama, and optional fine-tuning, to deliver smart, real-time assistance to bank clients.

The system enhances customer support by enabling:

AI-powered smart responses

Ticket reservation and appointment scheduling

Automatic form filling for banking services

## ✨ Features
🤖 Smart Responses: Answer customer queries (balances, services, card issues, FAQs) with context-aware, AI-powered replies.

📚 RAG Integration: Retrieve verified banking knowledge base entries to ensure answers are accurate and compliant.

🧠 Mistral + Ollama: Run models locally for secure, low-latency inference; supports fine-tuning for financial-specific terminology.

🎟 Ticket Reservation: Book banking appointments directly through chat (e.g., "Book me an appointment with a loan officer tomorrow at 10 AM").

📝 Smart Form Filling: Auto-complete loan applications, transfer requests, or account forms by extracting details from conversations.

🔒 Data Privacy First: Local model inference and configurable vector store for sensitive data.
## 🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend

⚛️ React (modern UI for chatbot & forms)

TailwindCSS (clean styling)

Backend

🐍 Django REST Framework

LangChain + Chroma/FAISS (for RAG and embeddings)

SQLite / PostgreSQL (database)

AI / Models

🧠 Mistral LLM served via Ollama

Fine-tuning support for banking-specific datasets

Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounded answers

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation Backend (Django + RAG + Ollama)
cd backend

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

## Frontend (React)
cd frontend

npm install

cp .env.example .env

npm start
## Ollama + Mistral
ollama pull mistral

ollama serve
## 🧠 How It Works
Client sends a message → Frontend sends request to Backend API.

Backend retrieves context with RAG from banking knowledge sources.

Mistral model (via Ollama) generates a response.

AI returns:

Smart banking answers

Pre-filled forms

Ticket booking confirmations
